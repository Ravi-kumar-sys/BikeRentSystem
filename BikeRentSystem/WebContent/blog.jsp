                                                                           <h4>The golden tip! Ensure that you adhere to all traffic restrictions while you?re on the road. It?s particularly important that you research traffic rules before you leave, as these can often change as you drive into a new country or state.  And ignorance of the law is not a valid defense.

                                                                             Understand that these rules are meant for your safety. Traffic rules hold prominence especially in hilly areas where one wrong step, one wrong turn can have a catastrophic end. So ensure that you are following the traffic rules.

                                                                              This might range from wearing a helmet, to carrying all the necessary documents with you on the journey, to adhering to the speed limits of the road. Don?t exceed the speed limit. Speed thrills, but ultimately kills.
                                                                               It doesn?t take bravery to ride your motorcycle in the city?it takes superior awareness, brains, an eye for potential hazards (not just obvious ones) and very good riding skills. Even if you put all these components together, there?s virtually no way to avoid at least a small accident, if not a much more serious one.

                                                                                But there are those who are committed to riding in the city, whether by necessity, for the thrill of it, or both. First of all, if you choose to ride in the city?whether it?s for your daily commute, errands or even just to see the sights?there?s no need to be intimidated, but you do need to think ahead and never stop
                                                                                  thinking throughout the ride. We?ve assembled some tips for you to ride smartly and skillfully on the mean streets of your urban jungle..</h4>
                                                                                    <h5><b><u> Make Them See You</u></b></h5>
                                                                                    <h4>We get that you like to dress in vintage black leather and denim when you ride your gorgeous café racer, but that?s not a smart way to protect your hide from the oblivious driving masses. Wear bright colors, especially on your helmet and jacket.
                                                                                        If you insist on wearing your darker jacket, try a reflective vest over it. This will have you look like a crosswalk guard at an elementary school, but it might just make the difference between life and death.
                                                                                    <h5><b><u>Stay in Open Zones</u></b></h5>
                                                                                    <h4> Two of the advantages of riding a motorcycle are power and control. These are your assets to stay safe, not to go bonkers on the pavement. Take advantage of these by staying out of wolf packs and in the open where you can stay out of blind spots,
                                                                                    work your way into gaps, and stay visible rather than remaining trapped in the flow of traffic where oblivious drivers won?t notice you.
                                                                                    <h5><b><u>The Deadly Left and Choose Your Lane Wisely</u></b></h5>
                                                                                    <h4> Don?t assume that the guy in oncoming traffic with his left turn signal on is going to see you. At times, they don?t even see actual cars, so your slim profile isn?t exactly conducive to visibility. Queue your high beams during the day and use 
                                                                                        your horn if need be to put them on alert. Watch for hand movement on the steering wheel and a head turn that usually occurs before the driver initiates the turn.
                                                                                        Also be prepared to get on the gas and swerve or brake if you have the time and distance.
                                                                                    Especially on highways and freeways where traffic is fast moving and there are multiple traffic lanes. Make sure to stay to your left. Everyone on the far right or in the lane adjacent to the right will bob and weave to make their exit,
                                                                                    and you don?t want to be anywhere near that. Merging traffic coming onto the highway is also deadly because they?re hell bent on getting to the left. Plus, if you?re to the far left, you only really have the lane to your right to contend with
                                                                                    rather than getting sandwiched between two sides. Just remember that some left lanes have no shoulder.</h4></p></center>
